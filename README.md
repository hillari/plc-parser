### PLC Assignment 4 - Lua Parser

The file parseit.lua implements a parser for the programming language "Degu", created by Dr. Glenn Chappell at the Univeristy of Alaska Fairbanks. It's based on the previous assgnment, a Lua lexer (found [here](https://github.com/hillari/plc-lexer)). This parser will determine the syntatic correctness and output an abstract syntax tree.
